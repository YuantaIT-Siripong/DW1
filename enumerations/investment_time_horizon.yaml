notes: |
  - Time horizon influences asset allocation and product suitability
  - SHORT_TERM typically paired with CONSERVATIVE risk levels
  - VERY_LONG_TERM suitable for RETIREMENT objectives and higher risk tolerance
  - Thailand retirement funds (RMF, SSF) require minimum holding periods
  - May remain UNKNOWN initially; should be collected during suitability assessment
  - Brokerage advisory uses horizon for liquidity planning
  
validation_rules:
  - Time horizon should align with investment objectives
  - SHORT_TERM + AGGRESSIVE risk level may trigger suitability warning
  - RETIREMENT objective should typically have LONG_TERM or VERY_LONG_TERM horizon
  - Liquidity needs should be consistent with time horizon
  
regulatory_references:
  - SEC suitability assessment standards
  - SET member firm investment planning guidelines
  - Thailand provident fund regulations (for retirement accounts)

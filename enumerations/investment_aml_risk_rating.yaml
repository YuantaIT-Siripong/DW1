  - Banks and brokerages integrate AML rating into transaction systems
  - Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) thresholds vary by rating
  - Periodic reassessment required, especially on suspicious activity
  
validation_rules:

  - PEP status often results in MEDIUM or HIGH rating
  - Large cash transactions trigger enhanced monitoring for MEDIUM/HIGH

set_membership_behavior: |
  Full set is re-materialized for each new profile version only when membership changes.
  Bridge rows are immutable once created (tied to specific profile version).
  
  ETL Process:
  1. Parse purpose_of_investment_list from Silver (pipe-delimited string)
  2. Split by "|" delimiter
  3. Normalize each code: UPPER(TRIM)
  4. Create one bridge row per code for the given customer_profile_version_sk
  5. Compute set hash for validation

hash_dependency:
  parent_set_hash_column: purpose_of_investment_set_hash
  computation_logic: |
    1. Retrieve all purpose_of_investment_code values for given customer_profile_version_sk
    2. Normalize each code: UPPER(TRIM)
    3. Deduplicate (should not happen in well-formed data)
    4. Sort codes ascending alphabetically
    5. Join with "|" delimiter (empty set -> "")
    6. SHA256(joined_string) -> purpose_of_investment_set_hash
    7. Verify hash matches dim_customer_profile.purpose_of_investment_set_hash
  
  example_sql: |
    SELECT LOWER(ENCODE(SHA256(STRING_AGG(purpose_of_investment_code, '|' ORDER BY purpose_of_investment_code)::bytea), 'hex'))
    FROM bridge_customer_purpose_of_investment
    WHERE customer_profile_version_sk = :version_sk;

materialization_strategy:
  approach: table
  reason: Bridge table for multi-valued relationship
  refresh_pattern: insert_only_on_new_version
  note:  Rows inserted only when dim_customer_profile gets new version with changed purpose_of_investment_set_hash

notes: |
  - Risk levels map to risk scores (1-10 scale where higher = more risk tolerant)
  - Used in product eligibility determination
  - Risk level assessment comes from customer questionnaire (source data not in this module)
  - Conservative levels restrict access to complex/high-risk products
  - Aggressive levels enable access to derivatives and leveraged products

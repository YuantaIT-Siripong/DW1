grain_description: One row per investment purpose membership for each customer profile version.  Multi-valued relationship between profile versions and investment purposes.

set_membership_behavior: |
  Full set is re-materialized for each new profile version only when membership changes.
  Bridge rows are immutable once created (tied to specific profile version).
  
hash_dependency:
  parent_set_hash_column: purpose_of_investment_set_hash
  computation_logic: |
    1. Retrieve all purpose_of_investment_code values for given customer_profile_version_sk
    2. Normalize each code: UPPER(TRIM)
    3. Deduplicate (should not happen in well-formed data)
    4. Sort codes ascending alphabetically
    5. Join with "|" delimiter (empty set -> "")
    6. SHA256(joined_string) -> purpose_of_investment_set_hash
    7. Store hash in dim_customer_profile for this version
  
  example_sql: |
    SELECT SHA256(STRING_AGG(purpose_of_investment_code, '|' ORDER BY purpose_of_investment_code))
    FROM bridge_customer_purpose_of_investment
    WHERE customer_profile_version_sk = :version_sk;
